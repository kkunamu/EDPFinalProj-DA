It will guide the trajectory of more detailed and operations-oriented agri-fishery development plans such as the commodity system roadmaps, Provincial Commodity Investment Plans (PCIPs), and Comprehensive Land Use Plans (CLUP). Thus, NAFMIP is more policy- and strategy-oriented, but not as detailed as previous AFMP iterations.
                        <br><br>
                        Further, NAFMIP shall aim to inspire the full range of private and public stakeholders to take coordinated, cohesive, and determined actions toward achieving a common vision and objectives, and to galvanize sector-wide public and private investments and resources to support the shared vision, objectives, and concerted action.
                        <br><br>
                        NAFMIP will seek to more than double smallholder farmers’ and fishers’ incomes to be able to meet their family household needs during the period of Plan implementation, through the promotion of transformative interventions to significantly diversify sources of income and employment—and ultimately sustainably lift farmers and fisherfolk out of poverty. This objective will be achieved with minimal impact on the environment and without sacrificing the nutrition and health of consumers. One key strategy is to diversify farming, non-farming, and value adding activities and link farmers and fisherfolk to large private investments such as modern food terminals and market hubs serving as potent engines of inclusive growth.

                        <p>The Adaptation and Mitigation Initiative in Agriculture (AMIA) is the flagship program of the Department of Agriculture (DA), dedicated to addressing the dual challenges of climate change: adaptation and mitigation. With a vision of achieving a climate-resilient Philippine agriculture, AMIA focuses on empowering vulnerable farmers and fisherfolk to combat the adverse effects of climate change while promoting sustainable agricultural practices.
                        <br><br>
                        The program is committed to advancing climate-resilient agriculture (CRA) practices by providing tailored, integrated, and responsive support services that enhance adaptive capacities in the face of environmental disruptions. These services include promoting innovative farming techniques, strengthening disaster risk reduction strategies, and introducing climate-smart technologies that can withstand extreme weather conditions, such as typhoons and droughts.
                        <br><br>
                        Climate change poses significant threats to food security in the Philippines, with observed increases in temperature, sea level rise, and more frequent and intense typhoons adversely impacting the agricultural sector. The AMIA Program seeks to mitigate these impacts through targeted interventions, community empowerment, and partnerships with various stakeholders. The program also emphasizes capacity-building, ensuring that local communities are equipped with the knowledge and tools to adapt and thrive despite climate challenges.
                        <br><br>
                        Through AMIA, the DA aims not only to safeguard food security and promote economic growth but also to foster rural development, ensuring that agriculture remains a sustainable and viable livelihood for future generations. By working together with local governments, farmers’ associations, and other partners, AMIA strives to build a resilient agricultural sector that can withstand the challenges of climate change while contributing to the nation’s long-term development goals. <a href="https://amia.da.gov.ph/" target="_blank">AMIA Website</a></p>

                        <p>The Special Area for Agricultural Development (SAAD) Program is a locally-funded initiative by the Department of Agriculture (DA) designed to alleviate poverty among marginalized sectors of agriculture and fisheries. Focused on thirty (30) priority provinces identified by the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA), as well as areas covered by Executive Order No. 70, series of 2018, the program targets vulnerable groups, including farmers, fisherfolk, Indigenous Peoples (IPs), and beneficiaries of the Department of Social Welfare and Development’s (DSWD) 4Ps program.
                        <br><br>
                        SAAD’s strategy centers on increasing food production, enhancing the resilience of rural communities, and establishing sustainable community enterprises. By providing essential support such as appropriate technology, financing, marketing assistance, and capacity-building services, the program empowers local communities to enhance agricultural practices, diversify sources of income, and improve overall livelihood opportunities. Through these services, SAAD aims to help communities gain greater economic independence and build resilience to the impacts of climate change and other environmental challenges.
                        <br><br>
                        The program targets sectors that have long been marginalized, helping them transition from subsistence farming to more productive, market-oriented livelihoods. By fostering community-driven projects and enterprises, SAAD contributes to the creation of local value chains in agriculture and fisheries, ensuring that products are not only produced but also marketed effectively. This comprehensive approach strengthens the agri-fishery sector, uplifts vulnerable groups, and encourages sustainable rural development.

                        <p>The Philippines, located in the Pacific typhoon belt, experiences around 20 tropical cyclones annually, severely impacting the agriculture and fisheries sector. In response to the country's vulnerability, Republic Act No. 10121 or the Philippine Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Act of 2010, was enacted to strengthen disaster resilience through four key pillars: prevention and mitigation, preparedness, response, and rehabilitation and recovery.

                        <p>The National Convergence Initiative for Sustainable Rural Development (NCI-SRD) is a unified strategy by four key government agencies—DA, DAR, DENR, and DILG—through Joint Administrative Order No. 01, series of 2020. This revised policy framework strengthens the collaboration of these agencies to deliver more efficient, coordinated, and sustainable rural development efforts.
                        <br><br>
                        The NCI-SRD was developed in response to the long-standing fragmentation of services across the rural development landscape. By harmonizing policies, programs, and resources, the initiative fosters improved governance, effective land use, and ecological balance through a watershed and major river basin-based planning approach. This ensures that natural ecosystems and human communities are developed cohesively and sustainably.
                        <br><br>
                        The initiative is brought to life at the local level through Convergence Area Development Plans (CADPs). These plans are tailored to the unique geographic, environmental, and socio-economic conditions of each area and guide the rollout of multi-sectoral interventions. Priority beneficiaries include smallholder farmers, both agrarian reform beneficiaries (ARBs) and non-ARBs, upland dwellers, fisherfolk, and Indigenous Peoples (IPs)—key communities that play critical roles in the country’s food production and ecosystem preservation.
                        <br><br>
                        All activities are guided by the ridge-to-reef approach, an integrated natural resource management framework that ensures interventions across landscapes—from upland watersheds down to coastal and marine ecosystems—are cohesive and mutually reinforcing.
                        <br><br>
                        Through shared leadership, resource complementation, and strategic alignment, the NCI-SRD envisions empowered rural communities thriving in a well-managed, sustainable, and resilient rural environment.
